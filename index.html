    <h2>Sneaky one</h2>
    <p> I can be really quiet (if I want to). Some of the time I sneak out and stay up later than I'm supposed to. Sometimes I steal but not a lot. I enjoy doing both, but I return most things that I take. These are some of the reasons I stay up late.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The thrill of disobediance</li>
      <li>To watch TV</li>
      <li>To sneak snacks</li>
      <li>Fun</li>
      <li>To chat with cousins on our phones</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Game Dev</h2>
    <p>I built my two games of my own, with help of course, but mostly my own design. I basically made rip off of some games I wanted to play. They were crappy but okay. I made a maze based off of the backrooms with no monsters and only one level. In my second game I made a hotel based off of the Roblox game Doors completly devoid of any doors and with only two monsters. It was fun, and hard. I had a good time doing it so I want to make more!</p>
    <h2>Big Family</h2>
    <p>
      I have a big family, and I dont know who half of my relaties are! I have a big hosehold family for starters, with the classic mom and dad but with five sisters added along to it, one two years younger than me, four years younger than me, six years younger than me, nine years younger than me, and one thirteen years younger than me! Other than that on my dads side i've got my dads brother his wife and three kids, my dads sister her husband and their son

    <h2>Game Player</h2>
    <p>I love videogames, and have loved videogames since I was 5. I play them all the time. I watch tutorials for help sometimes, other times I ask my parents for help, or I just explore on my own. I like open world games best, something about just finding new adventures and side quests is so amazing it just gives me thrills, I love finding new areas and items. (glitches and exploits too.) i like watching other people play it on youtubeto see them either to help me out or to see their reaction to things when the figure things out. The internet is such a great thing, I have grown up with it in almost every corner of my life it can be good, it can be bad. (My parents told me that) I have an amazing time playing with freinds, family, or just playing solo. Here are some of my favourite games!</p>
